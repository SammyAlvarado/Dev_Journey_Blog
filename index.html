                <p>
                What this blog really is about? It's a story about my journey and the struggles and acheviments of 
                becoming a web-developer. Through my eye's I hope I can inspire those learning or thinking of 
                programming. I can tell you so far the journey has been fun; sprinkled with a hint confusion of ones own ability 
                to learn. This path into tech is something I could only image others doing and only dreaming 
                of my abilities that which I am grasping today. I welcome you to read and experiance this journey 
                along side me. If you would like to network feel free to reach out
